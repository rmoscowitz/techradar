<p>I originally got this idea after reading a blog post titled <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/build-your-own-technology-radar">Build Your Own Technology Radar</a> by Neal Ford of ThoughtWorks. I was familiar with the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar but I had never considered creating a personal radar. Neal made some excellent points which convinced me to try it...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Once you started a career in software development, you signed a pact that promises you'll keep up with changes in that world."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Creating a technology radar for yourself helps you formalize your thinking, and balance some technologies (more cool factor, less likely to get a new job versus huge job market, but not interesting work)."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and finally...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"You should treat your technology portfolio like a financial portfolio: in many ways, they are the same thing. What does your financial planner tell you ? Diversify! Choose some technologies and/or skills that are widely in demand and track that demand. But you might also want to try some high risk/high reward technology gambits, like open source or mobile development."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're interested in creating a personal Technology Radar, I recommend forking <a href="https://github.com/bdargan/techradar">bdargan/techradar</a> and customizing the raw data.</p>
