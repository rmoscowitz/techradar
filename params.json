{"name":"Techradar","tagline":"My personal Technology Radar... Inspired by ThoughtWorks Technology Radar.","body":"### Personal Technology Radar\r\nI originally got this idea after reading a blog post titled [Build Your Own Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/build-your-own-technology-radar) by Neal Ford of ThoughtWorks. I was familiar with the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar but I had never considered creating a personal radar. Neal made some excellent points which convinced me to try it...\r\n\r\n> \"Once you started a career in software development, you signed a pact that promises you'll keep up with changes in that world.\"\r\n\r\nand...\r\n\r\n> \"Creating a technology radar for yourself helps you formalize your thinking, and balance some technologies (more cool factor, less likely to get a new job versus huge job market, but not interesting work).\"\r\n\r\nand finally...\r\n\r\n> \"You should treat your technology portfolio like a financial portfolio: in many ways, they are the same thing. What does your financial planner tell you ? Diversify! Choose some technologies and/or skills that are widely in demand and track that demand. But you might also want to try some high risk/high reward technology gambits, like open source or mobile development.\"\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in creating a personal Technology Radar, I recommend forking [bdargan/techradar](https://github.com/bdargan/techradar) and customizing the raw data.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nOctober 2015:\r\n![October 2015 Radar](../versions/October%202015.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
